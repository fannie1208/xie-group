Electron microscope and extreme matter (EM) lab aims to be a highly collaborative, nurturing, diverse and motivated team that is driven by a real passion for nuclear engineering, materials science and mechanical engineering, and an intense curiosity about why matters degrade and fail the way they do, and How to make them work better. We strongly encourage bold ideas and open discussions, craftsman spirit in experiments and critical thinking in data interpretation, a sense of urgency, and the determination to find the missing part of the puzzle.
